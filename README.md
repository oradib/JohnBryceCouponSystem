# JohnBryceCouponSystem
Hello there ≧◠‿◠≦✌︎
This project was the final piece to a 3 part project at John Bryce College, where I've studied Java Full-Stack Developer. It's a coupon merchant system, following very strict requirements by the school. I'm currently "modernizing" it for fun and practice, so stay tuned :]

If you'd like to try this project out for yourself, don't forget to go to the backend /resources/application.properties and change the username and password to match your details.
